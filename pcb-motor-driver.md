# RC Bot PCB Design

Now you made the RC control Application and the ESP32 controlling part, biut now for some reason your motor drivers keep blowing up, no wories this guide will help you in designing a custom PCB for your RC car. We'll walk through the basics of PCB design, important components like H-bridges, and reverse polarity protection, and suggest resources to help you get started, including learning KiCad and understanding ESP32-based board design.

## 1. Learn KiCad

KiCad is a powerful, free, and open-source PCB design tool used by professionals and hobbyists alike. It's the ideal software for designing your custom RC car PCB.

- **Official KiCad Documentation**: Start by going through the official KiCad documentation to familiarize yourself with the tool.
  - [KiCad Official Documentation](https://docs.kicad.org/)
- **Phil's Lab YouTube Channel**: For visual learners, Phil's Lab offers excellent video tutorials that dive deep into PCB design using KiCad. His videos will help you build a strong foundation.

## 3. ESP32 Documentation for Board Design

If you're using an ESP32 in your RC bot, it's important to refer to the ESP32 documentation to ensure proper integration, especially regarding pin assignments, power supply, and signal integrity.

- **ESP32 Board Design Guidelines**: Follow these guidelines to properly design the power, signal, and ground planes on your PCB when using an ESP32.
