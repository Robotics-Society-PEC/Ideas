# Sounding Rocket 

Designing a sounding rocket and gathering data from it is an exciting but challenging task. From maneuvering the rocket to collecting data and integrating sensors, the complexity quickly builds up. Luckily, ArduPilot, an open-source autopilot system, can handle the avionic system, sensor integration, and data parsing, which can then be transmitted to a ground station. However, there is a small catch: ArduPilot is built primarily for drones and traditional aerial vehicles, so creating a custom rocket vehicle type is necessary.

In this guide:
- Learning C/C++ for ArduPilot development.
- Setting up ArduPilot and learning how to create a custom vehicle (rocket).
- MAVLink protocol for communicating with ground stations.
- References to official documentation and tutorials for creating your vehicle in ArduPilot.

## 1. Learning C/C++ for ArduPilot Development

ArduPilot is primarily developed in C++, so having a solid grasp of C and C++ is essential for customizing vehicle types, adding new functionalities, or integrating specific hardware. If you're new to C/C++, here's how you can get started:

- **C++ Basics**: Start with learning the syntax and fundamental concepts like data types, functions, classes, and object-oriented programming. You can refer to this tutorial for C++ basics:
  - [C++ Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.learncpp.com/)

- **Embedded C++**: Since you'll be working with hardware and sensors, understanding embedded C++ programming is crucial. Focus on topics like:
  - Working with microcontrollers.
  - Managing low-level hardware interactions (GPIO, I2C, SPI, etc.).
  - Memory management for resource-constrained systems.

## 2. Setting Up ArduPilot and Custom Vehicle Development

ArduPilot supports different vehicle types like copters, planes, and rovers, but you'll be creating a custom rocket vehicle. Fortunately, ArduPilot provides extensive documentation on how to extend its platform to build new vehicles.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Create a Custom Vehicle in ArduPilot

1. **Install ArduPilot Development Environment**:
   - Follow the instructions to set up the development environment on your system using `git` and `waf` (the build system ArduPilot uses).
   - [Setting Up ArduPilot Development Environment](https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/where-to-get-the-code.html)

2. **Understand ArduPilot's Structure**:
   - Familiarize yourself with ArduPilot’s directory structure. Vehicle-specific code can be found in directories such as `/ArduCopter`, `/ArduPlane`, etc.
   - For your rocket, you’ll likely want to duplicate a vehicle directory and modify the dynamics, sensor input, and control algorithms.

3. **Custom Vehicle Documentation**:
   - Follow this tutorial to learn how to create your own vehicle in ArduPilot:
     - [Create Your Custom Vehicle in ArduPilot](https://discuss.ardupilot.org/t/adding-a-new-vehicle-from-scratch/37178)

4. **Implement Rocket-Specific Dynamics**:
   - Customize the flight dynamics specific to rockets, including thrust control, stabilization during ascent, and apogee detection.
   - Modify the `attitude controller` for stable flight and integrate custom sensors (like barometers, IMUs, and GPS).

5. **Test Your Custom Vehicle**:
   - Use **SITL (Software in the Loop)** to simulate the rocket in a safe environment before real-world deployment.
   - Once tested, deploy on supported hardware like the Pixhawk flight controller.

## 3. MAVLink: Communication with Ground Station

To send telemetry data and receive commands from the ground station, ArduPilot uses the **MAVLink** communication protocol. Understanding MAVLink is essential for real-time monitoring and control during your rocket's flight.

### Key MAVLink Concepts:
- **Telemetry**: Sends flight data like altitude, velocity, and sensor readings from the rocket to the ground station.
- **Commands**: Sends control commands from the ground station back to the rocket (e.g., abort mission, change trajectory).

### MAVLink Documentation and Tutorials:
- **MAVLink Official Documentation**:
  - [MAVLink Protocol Documentation](https://mavlink.io/en/)
  
- **Understanding MAVLink in ArduPilot**:
  - [ArduPilot MAVLink Communication](https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/mavlink-basics.html)

## 4. Integrating Sensors for Data Collection

ArduPilot supports a wide variety of sensors out of the box. For a sounding rocket, you might need:
- **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)**: For attitude and acceleration tracking.
- **Barometer**: To measure altitude.
- **GPS**: For position tracking.
- **Telemetry Radio**: To send real-time data to the ground station.

### Custom Sensor Integration:
You can write drivers for unsupported sensors by modifying the sensor interfaces within ArduPilot.
