# Robotic Arm Project

I have created a **Robotic Arm** simulation in **Gazebo**, and you can access the project on GitHub. This project involves controlling a robotic arm using **ROS** and **Docker**. Below are the necessary links and steps for getting started with the project.

## 1. Robotic Arm in Gazebo

You can access the GitHub repository for learning ROS here:

- **ROS Learning GitHub Repository**: [ROS Tutorial](https://github.com/Robotics-Society-PEC/Getting-Started-With-Robotics)

This project is designed to work with ROS and Docker, so you will need to get familiar with these tools.

### Learn ROS

ROS is a framework for developing robot software, and it is crucial for understanding how to control and simulate robots like the robotic arm.

- **Official ROS Tutorials**: [ROS Tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/)

### Learn Docker

Docker simplifies deployment and ensures that the simulation environment is consistent across machines. You will use Docker to run the robotic arm simulation.

- **Docker Documentation**: [Docker Get Started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)
- **Installing Docker**: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## 2. Tutorial on GitHub

I have created a step-by-step tutorial that explains how to set up the robotic arm simulation and control it.

- **Robotic Arm Tutorial Repository**: [Robotic Arm Tutorial](https://github.com/yourusername/robotic-arm-tutorial)

This tutorial includes all the necessary information to get the simulation running and covers the basics of ROS, Docker, and Gazebo.

## 3. Communicating with Motors Using micro-ROS

Now that you have the robotic arm simulation set up, the next step is to control actual motors. To do this, you'll need to create a controller that parses ROS topics and sends commands to the motors. For this task, **micro-ROS** is the perfect tool, as it allows ROS 2 to run on microcontrollers.

### micro-ROS Documentation

micro-ROS extends ROS 2 to microcontrollers, making it possible to control real hardware (e.g., motors) from ROS topics.

- **micro-ROS Official Documentation**: [micro-ROS Documentation](https://micro.ros.org/docs/overview/)

### Steps to Create a Motor Controller

1. **Set up micro-ROS**: Install micro-ROS on a compatible microcontroller (e.g., ESP32 or STM32).
   - **micro-ROS Hardware Platforms**: [Supported Hardware](https://micro.ros.org/docs/overview/hardware/)

2. **Create ROS Topics**: Define ROS topics that will be used for motor control (e.g., `/joint_commands`).

3. **Implement Controller**:
   - Write a **subscriber node** in micro-ROS that listens to motor command topics.
   - Parse the ROS messages and translate them into motor control signals (e.g., PWM for controlling speed).

4. **Bridge ROS and micro-ROS**: Set up communication between the ROS 2 system running on your computer and the microcontroller.
   - **Serial Communication**: Use UART or USB to connect the microcontroller to the computer.
     - [micro-ROS Serial Communication](https://micro.ros.org/docs/tutorials/advanced/streaming_interface/)

5. **Test and Debug**:
   - Test the controller with simulated messages in Gazebo.
   - Test the controller with real hardware motors by sending ROS commands.
