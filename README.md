# Ideas

So, you’ve found this repository. Now, you must be wondering: what is all this, and why does it even exist?

## What is this?

This is a repository of all the ideas I’ve had but never got around to implementing. Perhaps you might find some of them interesting and worth pursuing.

## Why?

I had several ideas I wanted to implement, but due to limited time and energy, I never got close to completing them. I’m documenting them here along with steps and resources to help bring these ideas to life.

## Projects and Ideas

Here’s a list of some of the projects. Each one links to a separate `.md` file containing more detailed descriptions, steps, and resources.

1. [UDP Control of RC Car](udp-control-rc-car.md)
2. [Creating an application to send UDP packets to the RC car](udp-packet-application.md)
3. [PCB design for Motor Driver](pcb-motor-driver.md)
4. [Brushed ESC (Electronic Speed Controller)](brushed-esc.md)
5. [Creating a model rocket in ArduPilot](ardupilot-rocket-model.md)
6. [Testing and adapting the Mission Control Ground Station](mission-control-ground-station.md)
7. [Custom JR Bay Module for Transmitters](jr-bay-module.md)
8. [Sending an RC Plane over long distances](long-distance-rc-plane.md)
9. [Robotic ARM (with Computer Vision)](robotic-arm-computer-vision.md)

>[!Important]
>- **Documentation**: Always refer to documentation wherever possible to ensure clarity and accuracy.
>- **PCB Creation**: For every electrical circuit in this project, a custom PCB should be created to ensure reliability and optimize performance.
>- **Power Delivery**: Pay special attention to power delivery. It is highly recommended to create your own power delivery solution rather than relying on off-the-shelf products, as they tend to be subpar.
